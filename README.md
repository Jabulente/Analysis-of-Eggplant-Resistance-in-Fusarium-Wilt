# Analysis-of-Eggplant-Resistance-in-Fusarium-Wilt
This project presents a data analysis of experimental trials aimed at evaluating the resistance of different eggplant genotypes to Fusarium wilt. Using Python and statistical methods, the analysis explores variations in disease incidence, severity, and plant performance to identify resistant varieties and inform breeding decisions.
